_override.sass 
	Basically says to make changes in _variable.sass

_custom.sass
	basically says to make any changes in the override.sass

Maybe copy _variables to _ovverride and edit there?


To me it seems like editing the _override variable is going to push those chages over the current settings in _variable, but I am not getting it do that. Going to message Chip, Clarity crator, to find out more.
