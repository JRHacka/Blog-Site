### Hello World!


JRHacka is the cool hacker name for Jake Rice. I graduated from the University of Missouri in May of 2022 with a major in business, a minor in information technology, and certificates in cybersecurity and sales & customer development. I was president of my fraternity, involved in the MU cybersecurity organization CyberTigers, and part of the Cornell Leadership Program.


Before I began my current journey with cybersecurity, I was a business major and believed I wanted to go into sales. My first internship was a sales internship, and between my experience there and with my classes I slowly became aware it wasnâ€™t for me. During my summer internship I began working on a data science Udemy, and after that an ethical hacker course. From there on out it was off to the races.


Ever since that moment I never doubted I had found my passion. I was extremely blessed and stumbled into a technician role with a local MSP upon my return from my internship. While gaining hands on experience there I have continued with rigorous self-education during my own time. Using the knowledge I have I want to help other beginners through various forms of media. Whether it is a video walkthrough of me completing a CTF, or a writeup on a piece of malware. My goal is to help other grow while I grow, and there is a lot of growing left to do.


Feel free to message me via email, LinkedIn, or Twitter if you ever have any questions. Enjoy the site and best of luck(:
