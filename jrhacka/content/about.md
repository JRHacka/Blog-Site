##### Hello World! (IYKYK) 
![Pic Here](BioPic.png)

My name is Jake Rice, and welcome to my site! Whether you are here for writeups, as a recruiter, or ended up here on accident I hope you enjoy. The rest of this article will just be a brief background on me and some of my interests. I was going to make this short, but then realized it's my site, and I can do what I want! 

 

I grew up in a pretty small town in southeast Missouri. My family was very much average middle class, and nothing particularly exciting on that front. My mom attended college for two years, but my dad had to begin working straight out of high school. I have two younger brothers Joe and James. We grew up a hardworking family, and my dad had my brother and I out doing yardwork or some project any free weekend or holiday. Even though I certainly did not enjoy it then I am glad I had that experience now. I give 100% of the credit to my parents when thinking about where my work ethic comes from.  

 

I suppose my interest in IT/Cybersecurity really started early on. I was very much a rule follower, so it isn't a cool backstory where I started hacking stuff at the age of 8 and cleaned up my act after jail. Instead, it was simply that I was the most tech savvy member of the family. While that may not be nearly as exciting as the alternative, I really did fall in love with tech because of seeing how much I could help people by fixing it. Throughout middle school and high school I would do troubleshooting for friends and neighbors, have brief brushes with introductory python, and mess around with machine hardware quite often. 

 

Then what I call the "business" school days came. During this time I was really just going through the motions, but I was doing those motions extremely well. I was a business major with a sales minor and was getting good grades in my classes. Absolutely killed it at my sales internship with Alan Wire (shoutout AW family), was in several school organizations and President of my fraternity, and even placed 2nd in a sales competition. I was just so bored, and you could tell because even though my classes we easy I had a 3.25 GPA just because I wasn't engaged. It was all just so... blah. That is when I stumbled upon what would be my true passion, Cybersecurity/Penetration Testing. 

 

During my internship I started taking a Udemy in data science and manipulation, and after talking with some others soon added on my IT minor at Mizzou. I finished a minor worth of classes in one academic year and didn't break a sweat. Not only did I not break a sweat, but I was genuinely enjoying them. I was truly engaged in my classes for once, and that led to a 4.0 perfect GPA when it came to my minor. I was doing the extra credit assignments not because I needed to, but because I yearned for that knowledge. I couldn't get enough. I found a part time job at an MSP in town (shoutout JSC family) and am still working there while I wait for my girlfriend to finish up graduate school. 

 

Right now, I am finishing up my CCNA and FSNA (it's a combination class so I will be prepared for both exams by the end). I am also currently in the PNPT Live seminar, and that has been a very cool course.  I have completed a few CTFâ€™s but won't list those off as I plan to upload all the writeups on here. I am doing TryHackMe, HTB, and PicoCTF to continue to grow and learn, and to answer your question you will see those on here too! 

 

That's more then enough about me, and if there is anything else you need to know my LinkedIn, email, and several other forms of contact are all on the site. Have fun and enjoy(:
