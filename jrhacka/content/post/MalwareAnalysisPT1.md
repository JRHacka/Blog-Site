In tthe spirit of getting better everyday I downloaded some malicious files from the site www.virusshare.com and am going to be spending some time playing around with them. I'll be using my REMNux VM and seeing what all I can figure out. Follow along for some beginner moves and learn with me along the way! Find the walkthrough video below and enjoy.

## Startup

First off I am going to be using REMNux, and while there are certainly other options this is the one I'm using for now. Feel free to use whichever you prefer, but to best follow along with me REMNux is going to be what you want to use. I have a tutorial written up for the install, and you can find there here: https://jrhacka.github.io/post/remnux_setup/

Once you spin up REMNux go ahead and head to www.virusshare.com. Just an FYI you will have to create an account, but it's a simple process and just use a "throwaway" email in case it does start to spam you with items. It does take a few moments for them to email you your username and password, but once that is done come back and we can pick up where we left off.

I created this account one week plus some before posting this article, and have not noticed anything malicious. Just in case be sure this isn't your main email.

Once that is done you can login with your username and password. From there select the option Torrents up at the top of the page. The file I seleted was the item at the top of the list, and called VirusShare_00000.zip and was 13.56GB. If it is not at the top of the list anymore I am so sorry, but the best thing I can think to tell you is find the file with that name. If they changed names... match the sizes...? 

So once you get that file you're going to want to use qbittorrent, or something like it, in order to get the actual zip file. If you do not have qbittorrent you can install it by running:
```bash
sudo apt install qbittorrent
```
Once you have that on go ahead and right click the downloade torrent and use open with qbittorrent. Once you have the zip file hop back into the command terminal and run:
```bash
unzip file/path/here
```

The REMNux terminal isn't the gretest, and won't even autofill files. I would be sure and install terminator to make your life a little bit easier.

## Organization

So now you have an absolute ton of greate malicious file examples to dive into. The key in this, and really anything, is going to be reamining organized. I made a new directory for completed VirusShare files. In that directory I also created a InProgress and Final subdirectory. You can name them or organize however you want, but just be sure you have an A(file from virusshare)-->B(In profress)-->C(Finished) methodology. That way you can keep track oas you work through them. The file I used for this analysis was XYZfilename. I copied it from it's place in the virusshare folder to the InProgress directory in a directory titled the date 081022. I am going to use the 081022 folder to keep all the data I generate for this malicious file. Now it's time to dive in.

## VirusTotal and Strings

So the first thing I'm always going to do is drop the file in www.virustotal.com and see what it gives me. When you drop our file in VirusTotal lights up like a Christmas tree. We can now confirm that this file is indeed malicious... lol.

The second thing I always do is probably very much up for debate. I learned this from John Hammond, and I do like to at least see what strings and file will tell me. 
```bash
file filename
strings filename
