## What is REMnux?

According to https://remnux.org/ REMnux is "a Linux toolkit for reverse-engineering and analyzing malicious software." Basically what that means is that what Kali is to offensive security REMnux is to malware analysis. It comes with tons of useful preinstalled and configured tools. In coming malware analysis post you will certainly see me use it, so in order for you to get the most out of the coming post you should install REMnux and follow along! 

## Install

The installation of REMnux is actually very easy and user friendly.
